## Pacific Sound AWS Open Data Registry Examples

Examples on how to access and process acoustic data from the pacific-sound free data archive. 

Data in these examples is being graciously hosted for free and open access by the Amazon 
[Registry of Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws), and includes raw data, derived data products, and analysis tools. 
These resources are intended for applications in ocean soundscape research, education, and the arts.  Audio recordings 
in this valuable archive would not be possible without the continued generous support from the
[David and Lucille Packard foundation](https://www.packard.org), including the ongoing support to keep the
[MARS Cabled Observatory](https://www.mbari.org/at-sea/cabled-observatory/about-mars/) online.

For more information about how the soundscape project, please see the [project page](https://www.mbari.org/mars-hydrophone/).
